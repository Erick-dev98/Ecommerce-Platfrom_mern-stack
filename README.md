# Ecommerce Platform (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a full-featured eCommerce platform built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The platform provides a seamless shopping experience with user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart, and order management functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT for authentication.
- **Product Management**: Admin can add, edit, or delete products with ease.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Processing**: Users can place orders, and admins can manage the order statuses.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order data.
- **Express.js**: Back-end framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Redux**: State management for handling application-wide state in a predictable manner.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

**You don't have to ever use eject**. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
